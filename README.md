# Refining Fake News Classification with Sentiment Analysis
## EMIS 8331: Advanced Data Mining, Southern Methodist University, Spring 2017

The identification of fake news is a pressing issue for media outlets and Internet platforms. Existing methods for identifying fake news target notorious sources and use basic word counts on the articles. These classifiers are more effective than expected, but they are insufficient for the certainty under which an identifying entity must operate. A random forest classifier using sentiment analysis greatly improves upon existing solutions.
